    "The code is an implementation of a popular interview problem called \"three sum\" or \"3sum\". The task is to find all unique triplets in a given array of integers that sum up to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this task, the algorithm goes through three nested loops to try every possible combination of three numbers from the array. The numbers are chosen one at a time, in order, and each combination is checked to see if the three numbers sum to 0.\n",

This is done by converting the tuple to a sorted tuple (in ascending order), to ensure that different orders of the same triplet are treated as the same.\n",

    "The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^3), where N is the length of the input 'nums' array. This is because the algorithm uses three nested loops to generate all possible combinations of three numbers in the array. The outer loop runs N-2 times, and the two inner loops each run N-1 and N times respectively. Therefore, the total number of iterations is (N-2)*(N-1)*N, which simplifies to O(N^3) time complexity.\n",

In the worst case scenario, when all possible combinations of three numbers in the input array sum up to 0, the number of elements in 'tempset' will be equal to the total number of unique triplets that can be formed from the input array, which is (N choose 3). Since the formula for (N choose 3) is N*(N-1)*(N-2)/6, this gives us a space complexity of O(N^3) as well. Finally, the algorithm uses a list of lists called 'triplets' to store the results, but its space requirement will be relatively small compared to the 'tempset' because it only stores unique triplets, sorted in ascending order, without duplicates, and so the space complexity of 'triplets' will not add to the space complexity of the 'tempset'."

    "This code implements the solution to the '3 Sum' problem, which is to find all unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero in a better approach than brute force. Here is a step by step explanation of the algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to iterate over the array with two for-loops. The outer loop ranges from 0 to n-1 (where n is the number of elements in the array). The inner loop ranges from i+1 to n. This means that we are considering all possible pairs of elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside the inner loop, we calculate the sum of the two elements (nums[i] + nums[j]). We then check if this sum has been seen before. We do this by checking if the sum is present as a key in the 'tracker' dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the sum is present in the 'tracker' dictionary, it means that we've already seen this sum before. That means we've seen two numbers in the input array that can form a pair that makes a sum equal to the \"number\" we are iterating over. So, we add all three numbers (nums[i], nums[j], and the 'number') to the 'tempset' set. We also create a tuple of these three elements, sort the tuple, and add it to the 'tempset' set. By adding the sorted tuple, we ensure that we are not adding duplicate triplets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the sum is not present in the 'tracker' dictionary, it means we haven't seen this sum before. In this case, we add the sum as a key-value pair to the 'tracker' dictionary with a value of 1. This value doesn't matter as we are only interested in the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once all pairs have been considered, we iterate over the set 'tempset', add each tuple to the 'triplets' list, and return the list. Whenever we add the tuple to the 'triplets' list, we convert the tuple back into a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code maintains a dictionary 'tracker' to keep track of the sums that have been seen before. The reason we clear the dictionary after the inner loop is complete is that we don't want to pair elements that occur before the current element. Instead of keeping track of pairs, we're keeping track of sums and triplets to eliminate complexity."
