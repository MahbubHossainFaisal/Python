    "### **Step-by-Step Explanation: Generating Subsequences**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction:**\n",
    "The concept we're dealing with here is about generating all possible subsequences of a given array. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Algorithm: Generating Subsequences (similar to Power Set):**\n",
    "The algorithm we're using here is similar to generating the Power Set of a set. It follows a recursive approach to generate all possible subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Let's take an example to understand this better. Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Starting the Recursive Function:**\n",
    "We start by calling the `subsequence` function with the initial parameters: `arr = [3, 1, 2]`, `n = 3` (length of the array), `i = 0` (starting index), and `ans = []` (empty answer list).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Base Case - Generating and Printing Subsequences:**\n",
    "Inside the `subsequence` function, we have a base case. When `i` becomes equal to `n`, it means we have considered all elements of the array. At this point, we print the elements in the `ans` list, which represent a subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this example:** When `i` becomes `3` (equal to `n`), the `ans` list will be `[3, 1, 2]`, and we print this subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Recursive Calls:**\n",
    "Before we reach the base case, we make two recursive calls:\n",
    "1. **Including the Current Element:** We append the current element `arr[i]` to the `ans` list and then make a recursive call with `i+1`. This simulates the case where we include the current element in the subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Excluding the Current Element:** We do not append the current element to the `ans` list and directly make a recursive call with `i+1`. This simulates the case where we exclude the current element from the subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this example:** When `i` is `0`, the first recursive call will be with `ans = [3]`, and the second call will be with `ans = []` (empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Backtracking:**\n",
    "After each recursive call, we pop the last element from the `ans` list. This is important because we need to backtrack and consider other possibilities while generating subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Final Output:**\n",
    "Following these steps, the code generates all possible subsequences of the given array `[3, 1, 2]` and prints them:\n",
    "```\n",
    "3 1 2 \n",
    "3 1 \n",
    "3 2 \n",
    "3 \n",
    "1 2 \n",
    "1 \n",
    "2 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Edge Cases:**\n",
    "1. If the input array is empty, the output will be an empty subsequence.\n",
    "2. If the input array contains duplicate elements, duplicate subsequences may be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are exploring two possibilities (including and excluding) for each element in the array, and we do this for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is the space needed for the recursive call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Efficiency:**\n",
    "The algorithm is already relatively efficient for generating all subsequences since there are 2^n possible subsequences in the worst case. Therefore, it's unlikely to find a significantly more efficient way to generate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Code Practices:**\n",
    "- Using clear and meaningful variable names: This makes the code more readable.\n",
    "- Commenting: Adding comments to clarify the purpose of the functions and steps can enhance code understandability.\n",
    "- Handling edge cases: Always consider scenarios where the input might be empty or contain duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Improvement and Clean Coding:**\n",
    "The provided code is fairly clean. However, one potential improvement is to encapsulate the code within a function, which helps in better organization and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand the concept and code better. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"

    "### **Step-by-Step Explanation: Generating Subsets with Target Sum**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction:**\n",
    "The concept we're dealing with here is backtracking, specifically solving the problem of finding all subsets of an array that have a certain target sum. This involves a recursive approach where we explore different possibilities while keeping track of the current sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Algorithm: Backtracking (Subset Sum):**\n",
    "The algorithm used here is similar to backtracking in a search space. It's not a well-known algorithm per se, but it shares similarities with other backtracking algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Let's consider the array `[1, 2, 1]` and the target sum `k = 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Starting the Recursive Function:**\n",
    "We initiate the process by calling the `sumK` function with initial parameters: `arr = [1, 2, 1]`, `n = 3` (length of array), `i = 0` (starting index), `k = 2` (target sum), `count = 0` (current sum), and `ans = []` (answer list).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Base Case - Found Valid Subset:**\n",
    "When `i` becomes equal to `n`, it means we've considered all elements. If the `count` (current sum) is equal to the target `k`, we print the `ans` list as it represents a valid subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this example:** No subset has been formed in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Recursive Calls:**\n",
    "For each element at index `i`, we have two recursive calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Include the Current Element:** We append the current element `arr[i]` to the `ans` list and update the `count` by adding the current element's value. This simulates the case where we include the current element in the subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exclude the Current Element:** We do not append the current element to the `ans` list and do not update the `count`. This simulates the case where we exclude the current element from the subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this example:** When `i` is `0`, the first recursive call is with `ans = [1]` and `count = 1`. The second call is with `ans = []` and `count = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Backtracking:**\n",
    "After each recursive call, we backtrack by removing the last element from the `ans` list and adjusting the `count` accordingly. This is crucial to explore other possibilities while generating subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Final Output:**\n",
    "Following these steps, the code generates subsets of the given array `[1, 2, 1]` that have a sum of `2` and prints them:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 1]\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Edge Cases:**\n",
    "1. If the input array is empty, no subset can be formed.\n",
    "2. If the input array contains negative values, the algorithm can still generate subsets with the target sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is exponential, specifically O(2^n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the algorithm explores all possible subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is the space needed for the recursive call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Efficiency:**\n",
    "The algorithm already explores all possible subsets, and since the problem involves finding all combinations that meet the target sum, there's no more efficient way to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Code Practices:**\n",
    "- **Variable Naming:** Use descriptive variable names that convey the purpose of each variable.\n",
    "- **Commenting:** Add comments to explain the purpose of functions, steps, and any complex logic.\n",
    "- **Code Encapsulation:** Encapsulate the code within a function for better organization and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Improvement and Clean Coding:**\n",
    "The provided code is well-structured and clean. However, one improvement could be encapsulating the logic within a function to enhance modularity and reusability.\n",
