    "The code is an implementation of finding the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using a binary search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the step-by-step explanation of the code logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function `findMin` takes an array `arr` as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to store the indices of the first and last elements of the array, respectively. `n` is assigned the length of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The variable `min_ele` is initialized with a large value (`sys.maxsize`) to store the minimum element.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The binary search algorithm is implemented with a while loop that continues until `low` becomes greater than `high`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inside the loop, the midpoint of the current sub-array is calculated using the formula `mid = math.floor((low + high) / 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The next step is to compare the element at the midpoint (`arr[mid]`) with the element at the start of the sub-array (`arr[low]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If `arr[mid] >= arr[low]`, it means the first half of the sub-array is sorted in non-decreasing order. In this case, we check if the element at the start of the sub-array (`arr[low]`) is smaller than the current minimum element (`min_ele`), and if true, update `min_ele` with the smaller value. Then, `low` is updated to `mid+1` to continue the search in the second half of the sub-array.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If `arr[mid] < arr[low]`, it means the second half of the sub-array is sorted in non-decreasing order. In this case, we check if the element at the midpoint (`arr[mid]`) is smaller than the current minimum element (`min_ele`), and if true, update `min_ele` with the smaller value. Then, `high` is updated to `mid-1` to continue the search in the first half of the sub-array.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. After the while loop terminates, the minimum element (`min_ele`) is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. In the main part of the code, an example array `arr` is created with values `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2]`. This array represents a rotated sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The `findMin` function is called with `arr` as an argument, and the returned minimum element is stored in the variable `ans`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Finally, the minimum element is printed to the console using `print(ans)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the code will be `1`, which is the minimum element in the rotated sorted array `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2]`."

    "\n",
    "The space complexity of the code is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of additional space for storing the indices (`low`, `high`) and the minimum element (`min_ele`).\n",
