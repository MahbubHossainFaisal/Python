    "1. The `checkPossibility` function calculates the total number of hours required to eat all the piles of bananas at a given eating speed (`k`).

    "\n",
    "4. The `minEatingSpeed` function then iterates over the range from 1 to the maximum value found in `piles`. For each value `i`, it calls the `checkPossibility` function to check if it is possible to eat all the piles at the eating speed `i` within the given hours `h`. If it is possible, it returns `i` as the minimum eating speed required.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If no minimum eating speed is found within the range, the function returns -1, indicating that it is not possible to eat all the piles within the given hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the example code, the `piles` list contains the number of bananas in each pile, and `h` is set to 8. The `minEatingSpeed` function is called with these inputs, and the result is printed."
