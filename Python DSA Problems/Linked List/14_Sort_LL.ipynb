    "## Algorithm: Merge Sort for Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that is used to efficiently sort a list or an array. It divides the list into smaller sublists, recursively sorts those sublists, and then merges them back together while maintaining the sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Merge Sort:\n",
    "Consider an unsorted array: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]\n",
    "1. Divide the array into two halves: [38, 27, 43] and [3, 9, 82, 10]\n",
    "2. Recursively sort the subarrays: [27, 38, 43] and [3, 9, 10, 82]\n",
    "3. Merge the sorted subarrays: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break down the provided code step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0: Function Definition\n",
    "Define a class `Solution` with a method `sortList` which takes a linked list `head` as input and returns a sorted linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Base Case\n",
    "Check if the `head` is `None` or if there's only one node in the list (`head.next` is `None`). In either case, return the `head` since there's nothing to sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Split the List\n",
    "Find the middle node of the linked list using the \"slow and fast pointers\" approach. Divide the list into two halves, `left` and `right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Recursion\n",
    "Recursively sort the `left` and `right` halves of the linked list using the `sortList` method. This step will keep dividing the list until the base case is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Merge Sorted Sublists\n",
    "Merge the two sorted sublists, `left_sorted` and `right_sorted`, using the `merge_sorted_lists` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Return Result\n",
    "Return the merged and sorted linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Case 1: Empty List\n",
    "If the linked list is empty (i.e., `head` is `None`), return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Case 2: Single Node\n",
    "If the linked list contains only one node (i.e., `head.next` is `None`), return the `head` as it is already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity:\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where \"n\" is the number of nodes in the linked list. The division step takes O(log n) time, and each merge step takes O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity:\n",
    "The space complexity of this algorithm is O(log n) due to the recursion stack used for the divide-and-conquer process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More Efficient Solution:\n",
    "The merge sort algorithm is already quite efficient for linked lists. There's no significantly more efficient solution in terms of time complexity. However, in some cases, you might consider using an \"in-place\" sorting algorithm like Quick Sort, but it comes with its own trade-offs and challenges for linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Coding Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularization**: Divide the code into well-structured functions or methods to improve readability and maintainability.\n",
    "2. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Use descriptive variable names that convey the purpose of the variables and improve code readability.\n",
    "3. **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic, especially when merging the sorted sublists.\n",
    "4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Address edge cases properly to ensure your code works for all scenarios.\n",
    "5. **Consistent Indentation**: Use consistent and clear indentation to enhance code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, clean and well-organized code is crucial for maintainability and collaboration among developers."
