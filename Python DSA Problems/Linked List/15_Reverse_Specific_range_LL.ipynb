    "**Step 0: Problem Statement**\n",
    "You have a singly-linked list and you're required to reverse a sublist of nodes between positions `left` and `right`, inclusively. Your task is to implement a function `reverseBetween` to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Algorithm - Reversing a Sublist**\n",
    "The algorithm you're using in your `reverseBetween` function can be likened to a subset of the classic \"Reverse Linked List\" problem. In that problem, you fully reverse a linked list. Here, you're doing a similar process but only for a portion of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Let's consider a linked list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `left = 2`, `right = 4`. The sublist to reverse is `[2, 3, 4]`. We'll reverse this sublist in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Edge Cases**\n",
    "- If the linked list is empty or has only one node, or if `left` is equal to `right`, there's no need to reverse anything. Return the head.\n",
    "- For the example above, where `left = 2` and `right = 4`, you need to make sure these positions are within the valid range of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Walkthrough the Code (Concepts Explained)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Create a dummy node and point it to the head of the linked list. This simplifies edge cases where the reversal starts from the head itself.\n",
    "   - Initialize a `prev` pointer which will eventually point to the node before the `left` position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Position `prev` and `left` pointers**:\n",
    "   - Move the `prev` pointer to the node just before the `left` position.\n",
    "   - Move the `left` pointer to the actual node at the `left` position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reversing the Sublist**:\n",
    "   - Initialize `current` and `tail` pointers to the `left` node.\n",
    "   - We'll iterate and reverse the sublist nodes between `left` and `right`. Each node's `next` pointer will be updated to the previous node in the reversed order.\n",
    "   - Keep track of the previous node (`prev_tail`) before updating the `current.next` pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connecting Reversed Sublist**:\n",
    "   - After the loop, the `prev_tail` points to the last node of the reversed sublist.\n",
    "   - Update `prev.next` to point to the new head of the reversed sublist (`prev_tail`).\n",
    "   - Update the `tail.next` pointer to point to the next node after the reversed sublist (`current`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning the Updated Head**:\n",
    "   - Return the `dummy.next`, which is the head of the modified linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Time and Space Complexity**\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. You traverse the list once to position the `prev` and `left` pointers, and then you reverse a portion of the list.\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(1), as you're not using any additional data structures except for a few pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Optimization Possibilities**\n",
    "- The code seems to be quite efficient for this problem. It already operates in O(N) time complexity, which is optimal for reversing linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Best Coding Practices**\n",
    "- Your use of a dummy node is a good practice as it simplifies handling edge cases and ensures you have a consistent starting point.\n",
    "- Comment your code to explain key steps and any complex logic.\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable names to enhance code readability.\n",
    "- Always check edge cases before applying any logic to prevent unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "With this detailed explanation, you should have a better understanding of the code, its concepts, possible optimizations, and best coding practices. Keep practicing and refining your coding skills to become a proficient software engineer!"
