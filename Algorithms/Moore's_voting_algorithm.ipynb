    "Moore's Voting Algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the majority element in an array. The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than n/2 times in an array of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Moore's Voting Algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize two variables, `candidate` and `count`. Set `candidate` to None and `count` to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterate through the array, element by element.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each element, if `count` is 0, assign the current element as the `candidate` and set `count` to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the current element is the same as the `candidate`, increment `count` by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If the current element is different from the `candidate`, decrement `count` by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After iterating through the entire array, the `candidate` will hold the majority element.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Perform a second pass through the array to verify if the `candidate` is indeed the majority element by counting its occurrences. If it appears more than n/2 times, it is the majority element. Otherwise, there is no majority element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple implementation of Moore's Voting Algorithm in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_majority_element(nums):\n",
    "    candidate = None\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for num in nums:\n",
    "        if count == 0:\n",
    "            candidate = num\n",
    "            count = 1\n",
    "        elif num == candidate:\n",
    "            count += 1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            count -= 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Verification step\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    for num in nums:\n",
    "        if num == candidate:\n",
    "            count += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if count > len(nums) // 2:\n",
    "        return candidate\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call this function by passing your array as an argument. It will return the majority element if it exists, or None if there is no majority element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this algorithm assumes the majority element always exists. If there is a possibility that the array may not contain a majority element, you may need to add additional checks or modify the algorithm accordingly."
