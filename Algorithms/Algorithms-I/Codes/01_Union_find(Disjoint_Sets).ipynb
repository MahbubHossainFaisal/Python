    "**Concept Explanation: Disjoint Set (Union-Find) Data Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Disjoint Set data structure, also known as Union-Find, is used to manage a partition of elements into disjoint sets. It supports two main operations: finding the representative element (parent) of a set and merging two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Explanation: Union by Rank with Path Compression**\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implements the Disjoint Set data structure using the Union by Rank heuristic for merging sets. Union by Rank optimizes the merging process by always attaching the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. This helps to keep the overall depth of the tree small. Additionally, path compression is used during find operations to further optimize the data structure by making each node directly point to its ultimate parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step by Step Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):** Create the Disjoint Set data structure with `n` elements. Initialize the `rank` and `parent` arrays. Each element starts with its own parent and a rank of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding the Ultimate Parent (`find_UParent` method):** Recursively find the ultimate parent of a node while also compressing the path by updating the parent of all traversed nodes to the ultimate parent. This improves the efficiency of future find operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Union by Rank (`union_By_Rank` method):** Merge two sets represented by `u` and `v`. First, find the ultimate parents of `u` and `v`. Compare their ranks. If they are equal, choose one as the parent and increase its rank. If they are not equal, make the parent of the smaller-ranked set point to the parent of the larger-ranked set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Printing Ranks (`print_rank` method):** Print the rank of each node in the data structure. The rank is an indicator of the height of the tree, which affects the efficiency of the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Printing Parent Array (`print_parent` method):** Print the ultimate parent of each node in the data structure. This shows the connected components of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Checking Connections (`check_connections` method):** Determine whether two nodes `u` and `v` are in the same set by comparing their ultimate parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario with seven nodes. Perform unions and checks to illustrate how the data structure changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge Cases and Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try union and check operations on nodes that are not initially connected.\n",
    "- Perform union operations on nodes with the same rank.\n",
    "- Perform union operations on nodes with different ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity of the `find_UParent` operation is amortized O(log n) due to path compression and the rank heuristic.\n",
    "- The time complexity of the `union_By_Rank` operation is O(log n) due to rank-based merging and path compression.\n",
    "- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the rank and parent arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Path Halving:** Modify the path compression to halve the path length in each step instead of compressing it to the ultimate parent. This can provide a better balance between time and space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable names for improved readability.\n",
    "- Add docstrings to methods to explain their purpose and usage.\n",
    "- Ensure consistent indentation for better code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, clean code is not just about functionality but also about making the code understandable and maintainable for you and others."
